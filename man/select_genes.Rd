\title{Select genes in a cell_data_set for dimensionality reduction}
\usage{
select_genes(cds, fit_min = 1, fit_max = Inf, logcv_ll = NULL,
  logcv_ul = NULL, logmean_ul = NULL, logmean_ll = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{the cell_data_set upon which to perform this operation.}

\item{fit_min}{the minimum multiple of the dispersion fit calculation; default = 1}

\item{fit_max}{the maximum multiple of the dispersion fit calculation; default = Inf}
}
\value{
an updated cell_data_set object with selected features
}
\description{
Monocle3 aims to learn how cells transition through a
biological program of gene expression changes in an experiment. Each cell
can be viewed as a point in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension
describes the expression of a different gene. Identifying the program of
gene expression changes is equivalent to learning a \emph{trajectory} that
the cells follow through this space. However, the more dimensions there are
in the analysis, the harder the trajectory is to learn. Fortunately, many
genes typically co-vary with one another, and so the dimensionality of the
data can be reduced with a wide variety of different algorithms. Monocle3
provides two different algorithms for dimensionality reduction via
\code{reduce_dimensions} (UMAP and tSNE). The function
\code{select_features} is an optional step in the trajectory building
process before \code{preprocess_cds}.  After calculating dispersion for
a cell_data_set using the \code{calculate_gene_dispersion} function, the 
\code{select_genes} function allows the user to identify a set of genes
that will be used in downstream dimensionality reduction methods.
